# 🎯 Student Performance Prediction

This project predicts student performance based on various factors like gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation course. It uses Machine Learning techniques to analyze student data and forecast their scores.



## 🚀 Features
- Predicts student performance based on multiple parameters
- Uses Flask for a web-based interface
- Machine Learning model trained on real-world data
- Data preprocessing with Scikit-Learn
- Interactive UI for user input and result display



## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sridharsahu125/Student-Performance-Prediction.git
cd Student-Performance-Prediction


###2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

📌 Open in Browser: http://127.0.0.1:5000/


## 📊 Dataset Details
The dataset contains student details such as:
- `gender`: Male/Female
- `race_ethnicity`: Group A, B, C, D, E
- `parental_level_of_education`: High school, Bachelor's, Master's, etc.
- `lunch`: Standard/Free or Reduced
- `test_preparation_course`: Completed/None
- `reading_score`, `writing_score`: Student's test scores

These features are used to predict student performance.
